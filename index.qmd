## Project Summary 

Driven by global warming, widespread glacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau poses significant threats to ecosystems and water resources. 

This project maps glacier-affected regions from 2000 to 2020, aiming to assess glacier changes and their implications for conservation planning. Integrating multi-source datasets, the project classifies glacier-impacted areas and conducts protective planning analysis aligned with Chinese national standards. 

The findings support ecological protection efforts and inform municipal-level spatial planning, assisting governmental planners in making informed land-use decisions and monitoring ecological changes for sustainable conservation strategies.

### Problem Statement 

Glacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau threatens both ecological stability and water security, further challenging traditional spatial planning frameworks.

Despite recent policy advances, current planning practices still overlook the changes induced by glacier retreat, leading to gaps in conservation planning.

To address these challenges, this project seeks to answer the question: 

**What spatial impacts have glacier changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had on the regional ecosystem and territorial spatial planning?**

Based on this, the project develops a spatial tool that maps glacier-affected regions and integrates glacial change indicators into municipal-level spatial planning to support adaptive governance.

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
