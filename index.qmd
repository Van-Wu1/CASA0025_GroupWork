## Project Summary 

background: Driven by globle warming, many glaciers show signs of reteart across Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which poses significant threats to high-altitude ecosystems and regional water resources. 
study：This project maps glacier-affected regions across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000-2020, aiming to understand glacier changes and their implications for conservation planning.
methodology: Using multi-source geospatial datasets, including glacier elevation, temperature, vegetation indices, and water bodies, we map and classify areas impacted by glacial retreat.

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
