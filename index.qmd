## Project Summary

Driven by global warming, widespread glacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau poses significant threats to ecosystems and water resources.

This project maps glacier-affected regions from 2000 to 2020, aiming to assess glacier changes and their implications for conservation planning. Integrating multi-source datasets, the project classifies glacier-impacted areas and conducts protective planning analysis aligned with Chinese national standards.

The findings support ecological protection efforts and inform municipal-level spatial planning, assisting governmental planners in making informed land-use decisions and monitoring ecological changes for sustainable conservation strategies.

### Problem Statement

- Background

Glacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau threatens both ecological stability and water security, further challenging traditional spatial planning frameworks.

![Global Glacial Retraet, 1960-2005 ([Source](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/7679/glacial-retreat))](images/glacier_loss_00.jpg){ width=80% }

Despite recent policy advances, current planning practices still overlook the changes induced by glacier retreat, leading to gaps in conservation planning.

- Research Question

To address these challenges, this project seeks to answer the question:

**What spatial impacts have glacier changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had on the regional ecosystem and territorial spatial planning?**

Based on this, the project develops a spatial tool that maps glacier-affected regions and integrates glacial change indicators into municipal-level spatial planning to support adaptive governance.

### End User

- Who are we building for?

    - Local Governments: To obtain city-level glacier impact summaries and detect spatial planning conflicts.

    - Environment Agencies: To monitor the cascading effects of glacier retreat.

    - Research Institutions: To access dynamic glacier data and models.

    - Public: To enhance awareness of glacier protection.

    - Construction Companies: To avoid site selection in areas affected by glacier changes.

![Target Users](images/users.png)

- What needs does it address?

    - Governments and agencies need tools to support adaptive spatial planning and risk mitigation.

    - Researchers require reliable glacier data for scientific modeling.

    - The public benefits from increased awareness and educational outreach on environmental changes.

    - Construction sectors need early warnings and site selection guidance to minimize future risks.

### Methodology

- Defining Glacier-Affected Regions

Based on published study (Zhang et al., 2016), calculating Relative Glacier Meltwater Contribution (RGMC) to identify cities influenced by glacier melt-water.

$$ \text{RGMC} = 7.22 \cdot (\text{Glacier Area}/\text{Basin Area})^{0.61} $$

- Environmental Data Processing and Analysis

Glacier Retreat Indicators: NDVI (vegetation regrowth as a proxy for glacier retreat) and Temperature (warming trends) were analyzed using GEE datasets.

- Spatial Suitability Zoning

Integrated "Dual Evaluation" framework (national guideline) while adding glacier melt-water into analysis.

- Conflict Detection and Visualization

Automatic detection of the spatial conflict between the recalculated land use within the glacier-affected area and the current land use. Provide decision-makers with municipal summaries and structured outputs.

### Interface

The application's interface is designed to address the needs of spatial planners, policy stakeholders, and researchers seeking to understand and integrate glacier-related environmental changes into spatial governance.

The layout consists of a control panel and a map visualization area:

- The left-side panel【待补充交互判定】 provides project information, instructions, module switching buttons, a layer selector, year sliders, and a dynamic attribute table.

- The map area supports both split-screen synchronized maps for temporal comparison (2000–2020) and single-map evaluation mode for zoning and suitability assessments.

- 【待补充交互判定】

Users can interactively:

- Compare glacier thickness, temperature, NDVI, and water body changes across different years using dual synchronized maps.

- Drag a center slider to visually contrast two temporal layers.

- Switch between "Interannual Comparison" and "Dual Evaluation" 【待补充交互判定】modules to examine both environmental change processes and spatial suitability outcomes.

- Click on municipalities to retrieve dynamic attribute tables summarizing mean, minimum, maximum values, or water body areas.

- View adaptive legends that automatically adjust to the selected thematic layer, ensuring

Overall, the interface prioritizes visual clarity, interactive exploration, and decision-making support for integrating glacial dynamics into territorial planning.

## The Application

Warnign: Users need to register and log in to GEE to obtain the loading of data

## How it Works

The application is built using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API. It integrates modular components for style definition, data processing, dynamic visualization, user interaction, and spatial querying.

### Data Preparation

Study regions and glacier-affected areas are defined using FeatureCollections, and time-series datasets are accessed via project-specific assets:

```js
var defaultRegion = ee.FeatureCollection(...);
var boroughRegion = ee.FeatureCollection(...);
function getGlacierElevation(year) {...}
function getTempByYear(year) {...}
function getNDVIImageByYear(year) {...}
function getWaterbodyByYear(year) {...}
```

### Layer Visualization

Dynamic rendering of thematic layers is implemented:

```js
function getLayer(type, year) {...}
```

Each layer (e.g., glacier change, temperature, NDVI, water body extent) is classified into meaningful categories and color-mapped using tailored palettes.

In the "Dual Evaluation" mode, ecological protection importance, agricultural suitability, and urban construction suitability are visualized:

```js
function getLayer2(type) {...}
```

### Interactive Map Control

A split-panel map structure enables side-by-side comparisons:

```js
ui.Map.Linker([leftMap, rightMap]);
```

Users can select variables, adjust independent year sliders for each panel, and manipulate the wipe tool to analyze changes.

Switching between modules dynamically updates the interface to match the analysis purpose (temporal change vs. suitability evaluation).

### Region Query and Attribute Tables

Clicking on a municipality triggers spatial queries using zonal statistics:

```js
function handleMapClick(coords, mapSide) {...}
```

The application extracts mean, minimum, maximum, or total area values based on the selected theme, and displays a comparative attribute table.

Interannual differences are computed as:

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Value}_{\text{Right Year}} - \text{Value}_{\text{Left Year}}
$$

Color coding highlights positive or negative changes depending on the indicator (e.g., glacier loss in red, ecological gain in green).

### Legend Management

Legends are dynamically generated and updated according to the active map layer, ensuring accurate interpretation of categorical classes and numerical ranges:

```js
function updateLegend(type, panel) {...}
```

This modular and user-oriented structure enables flexible exploration, rigorous analysis, and practical support for spatial decision-making regarding glacier-affected regions on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
