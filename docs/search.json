    "text": "1 Project Summary\nDriven by global warming, widespread glacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau poses significant threats to ecosystems and water resources.\nThis project maps glacier-affected regions from 2000 to 2020, aiming to assess glacier changes and their implications for conservation planning. Integrating multi-source datasets, the project classifies glacier-impacted areas and conducts protective planning analysis aligned with Chinese national standards.\nThe findings support ecological protection efforts and inform municipal-level spatial planning, assisting governmental planners in making informed land-use decisions and monitoring ecological changes for sustainable conservation strategies.\n\n1.1 Problem Statement\n\nBackground\n\nGlacier retreat across the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau threatens both ecological stability and water security, further challenging traditional spatial planning frameworks.\n\n\n\nGlobal Glacial Retraet, 1960-2005 (Source)\n\n\nDespite recent policy advances, current planning practices still overlook the changes induced by glacier retreat, leading to gaps in conservation planning.\n\n\n\nLogical Schematic Diagram\n\n\n\nResearch Question\n\nTo address these challenges, this project seeks to answer the question:\nWhat spatial impacts have glacier changes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau had on the regional ecosystem and territorial spatial planning?\nBased on this, the project develops a spatial tool that maps glacier-affected regions and integrates glacial change indicators into municipal-level spatial planning to support adaptive governance.\n\n\n1.2 End User\n\nWho are we building for?\n\nLocal Governments: To obtain city-level glacier impact summaries and detect spatial planning conflicts.\nEnvironment Agencies: To monitor the cascading effects of glacier retreat.\nResearch Institutions: To access dynamic glacier data and models.\nPublic: To enhance awareness of glacier protection.\nConstruction Companies: To avoid site selection in areas affected by glacier changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Users\n\n\n\nWhat needs does it address?\n\nGovernments and agencies need tools to support adaptive spatial planning and risk mitigation.\nResearchers require reliable glacier data for scientific modeling.\nThe public benefits from increased awareness and educational outreach on environmental changes.\nConstruction sectors need early warnings and site selection guidance to minimize future risks.\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Data\nThis project utilizes a range of geospatial and environmental datasets to assess glacier changes and support spatial planning analysis. The datasets, sourced from public Earth observation platforms and third-party research institutions, include glacier boundaries, temperature records, vegetation indices, elevation models, administrative boundaries as well as other related dataset.\nAll datasets have been pre-processed to ensure consistency in spatial resolution and temporal coverage where necessary.\n\n\n\nData\nAsset\nSources\n\n\n\n\nGlacier Boundary\nGLIMS/20230607\nGLIMS2023\n\n\nGlacier Change\nThird party dataset\nSEDOO\n\n\nTemperature (2000-2014)\nThird party dataset\nTPDC\n\n\nTemperature (2015-2020)\nThird party dataset\nworldclim\n\n\nNDVI\nMODIS/061/MOD13A2\nMOD13A2.061\n\n\nWaterbody\nJRC/GSW1_4/YearlyHistory\nJRC\n\n\nDigital Elevation\nNASA/NASADEM_HGT/001\nNASADEM\n\n\nSoilGrids\nprojects/soilgrids-isric/layer_name\nISRIC\n\n\nPrecipitation\nUCSB-CHG/CHIRPS/DAILY\nCHIRPS\n\n\nPM2.5\nprojects/sat-io/open-datasets/GLOBAL-SATELLITE-PM25/ANNUAL\ngee-community-catalog\n\n\nNatural Ecological Resource Data\nThird party dataset\nTPDC\n\n\nBasin Boundary\nWWF/HydroATLAS/v1/Basins/level06\nWWF\n\n\nTibet Plateau Boundary\nThird party dataset\nTPDC\n\n\nChinese Municipal Boundary\nThird party dataset\ntianditu\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4 Methodology\n\nDefining Glacier-Affected Regions\n\nBased on published study (Zhang et al., 2016), calculating Relative Glacier Meltwater Contribution (RGMC) to identify cities influenced by glacier melt-water.\n\\[ \\text{RGMC} = 7.22 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{Glacier Area}}{\\text{Basin Area}} \\right)^{0.61} \\]\n\nEnvironmental Data Processing and Analysis\n\nGlacier Retreat Indicators: NDVI (vegetation regrowth as a proxy for glacier retreat) and Temperature (warming trends) were analyzed using GEE datasets.\n\nSpatial Suitability Zoning\n\nIntegrated “Dual Evaluation” framework (national guideline) while adding glacier melt-water into analysis.\n\n\n\nDual Evaluation Flow Map\n\n\n\nConflict Detection and Visualization\n\nAutomatic detection of the spatial conflict between the recalculated land use within the glacier-affected area and the current land use.

The map area supports dual synchronised maps, single map evaluation and conflict detection modes.\nUsers can compare environmental changes from 2000 to 2020, switch among Interannual Comparison, Dual Evaluation, and Conflict Detection modules, and click glacier-affected areas to retrieve attribute tables or query conflict zones.\nAdaptive legends automatically update, ensuring clarity and supporting modular exploration and decision-making."

    "text": "3 How it Works\nThe application is built using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript API. It integrates modular components for style definition, data processing, dynamic visualization, user interaction, querying, and spatial conflict detection.\n\n3.1 Data Preparation\nStudy regions and glacier-affected areas are defined using FeatureCollections, and time-series datasets are accessed via project-specific assets:\nvar defaultRegion = ee.FeatureCollection(...);\nvar boroughRegion = ee.FeatureCollection(...);\nfunction getGlacierElevation(year) {...}\nfunction getTempByYear(year) {...}\nfunction getNDVIImageByYear(year) {...}\nfunction getWaterbodyByYear(year) {...}\nAdditionally, conflict datasets are prepared by combining:\n\nEcological protection zones (evaluation results)\nBuilt-up areas and cropland areas (ESA WorldCover land cover data)\n\nThe intersections of ecological zones with urban or agricultural areas are extracted to identify potential conflict zones.\nvar conflict_urban = built_up.and(eco_zone);\nvar conflict_cropland = cropland.and(eco_zone);\n\n\n3.2 Layer Visualisation\nDynamic rendering of thematic layers is implemented:\nfunction getLayer(type, year) {...}\nEach environmental indicator is classified into categories and mapped with specific palettes.\nSuitability evaluation layers and conflict detection layers are dynamically updated based on the active module.\n\n\n3.3 Interactive Map Control\nA split-panel map structure enables side-by-side comparisons for interannual environmental changes:\nui.Map.Linker([leftMap, rightMap]);\nIn other modules, single maps display suitability or conflict zones.\nUsers can dynamically switch between modules with intuitive UI controls, adjusting the map view accordingly.\n\n\n3.4 Region Query, Attribute Tables, and Conflict Detection\nClicking on a glacier-affected area in an administrative region triggers the generation of an attribute table via regional statistics:\nfunction handleMapClick(coords, mapSide) {...}\nInterannual differences are calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\text{Value}_{\\text{Right Year}} - \\text{Value}_{\\text{Left Year}}\n\\]\nIn conflict detection mode, clicking a location evaluates whether it falls into:\n\nUrban-ecology conflict zone (built-up land encroaching ecological areas)\nAgricultural-ecology conflict zone (cropland encroaching ecological areas)\n\nQuery results are displayed with color-coded labels indicating conflict status.\nfunction setupConflictDetection() {...}\n\n\n3.5 Legend Management\nLegends are automatically updated for each data layer and module, including ecological evaluation classes, land suitability levels, and conflict zones.\nfunction updateLegend(type, panel) {...}\nThe modular architecture of our GEE app ensures flexible exploration, spatial conflict analysis and practical support for decision-making in glacier-affected areas.\n奥老师的示例如下： You can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large t = {\\frac{\\overline{x_1}-\\overline{x_2}} {\\sqrt{\\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \\frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} \\]"
